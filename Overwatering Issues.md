Here is a case study on problems with overwatering a garden and potential solutions:

The Problem of Overwatering

John was an avid gardener who took great pride in his vegetable garden. However, he struggled with determining the right amount of water for his plants. Worried about the plants not getting enough water, John started overwatering. He watered the garden deeply every day, regardless of rain or soil moisture. 

Over the next few weeks, John noticed some issues emerging:

- Seedlings were dying soon after sprouting. The excess moisture was causing the tender roots to rot.

- Leaves on John's tomato plants were turning yellow and wilting. Too much water was washing away critical nutrients. 

- Snails and slugs were flocking to the wet soil, munching leaves and vegetables overnight. 

- Sections of the garden had standing water and muddy soil, which can encourage fungal growth.

Overall, the overwatering compromised the health of John's plants and created conditions ripe for pests and diseases.

Solutions to Overwatering

To address the overwatering problem, John took these steps:

- He adjusted the watering schedule to 2-3 times a week rather than daily. This allowed the soil to partially dry out between waterings.

- John mulched around the plants to help retain soil moisture and reduce water requirements.

- He monitored the soil moisture by finger testing it before watering. If the top few inches were moist, John held off on watering.

- John addressed drainage issues by creating raised beds and grading the yard to prevent standing water.

- He added organic matter like compost to help the soil better absorb and retain water. 

- John trimmed back any diseased or neglected plants and disposed of severely affected plants.

With these solutions, John was able to strike a better balance with watering his garden. The reduced watering frequency encouraged healthier roots and soil. Pest and disease pressure subsided as well. Overall, adjusting the watering practices established optimal moisture levels for the plants to thrive.
